- 👋 Hi, I’m @IKChego
- 👀 I’m interested in coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning responsive web design on freecode camp and open to suggestions of other free coding platforms challenging enough.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any beginner friendly projects, tests on responsive web design side of things. Point me towards newbies projects, thanks.
